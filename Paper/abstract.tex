In network terminology a community corresponds to a population in which each individual in the population shares a common property. This property can be either a relationship such as friendship in Facebook, or an activity such as giving a citation in a paper resulting in co-citation network. In social networks, communities generally overlap with some other communities. There are not many algorithms presented in the literature for overlapping community detection. Almost all the studies are written in serial programming paradigm. We attempt to fill this gap in the literature. We introduce fast and scalable parallel overlapping community detection technique by using PCJ library as the parallel programming framework and Demon algorithm to discover overlapping communities. Experiment results are promising even though the graphs that we use have strong data dependency.
